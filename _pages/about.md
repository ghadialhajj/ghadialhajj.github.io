Bio
======
Welcome to my personal page. I am currently a PhD fellow at the University of Oslo, working with Deep Learning, both theory and applications, specifically in the computational immunology field.

Before starting my PhD, I got my BSc and MSc degrees in Biomedical Engineering, where I did my master's thesis on a machine learning application, and that is how I got into the ML field.

My research interests include, but are not restricted to, deep learning, general machine learning, computer vision, deep learning theory, causality and causal inference, inductive biases, and incorporating domain knowledge.

I'm also a hands-on person and like to build things myself, whether it's DL models, software packages, or cloud solutions. For that, I'm constantly on the hunt to acquire new skills and learn about new topics that would enhance my profile as a researcher and data scientist.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading and playing the electric guitar.
